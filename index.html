<p> I was born in Ghana in 2003 and came to the U.S in late 2006.
<br> I love to play Football and video games in my free time.
<br> Currently, I am undecided in the School of Information Studies 
<br> but in the fall of sophomore year, I will declare my major in 
<br> Information Management Technology.</p>
